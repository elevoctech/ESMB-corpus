# ESMB(Elevoc Simultaneously-recorded Microphone/Bone-sensor) speech corpus

###  This corpus consists of 128 hours of Chinese speech uttered by 131 male and 156 female speakers. During recording, speech is captured by a pair of Elevoc Clear earbuds, in which a ST 25ba BC sensor is located near the ear canal to collect skull vibrations, and the AC sensor is outside the ear and serves as the close-talk microphone. Each speaker reads Chinese prompts for around 20 minutes, and a 16 kHz stereo speech is recorded by each earbud.
